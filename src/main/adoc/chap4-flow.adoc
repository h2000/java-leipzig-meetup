== Reactive Streams (pull-push)

TODO
https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/2018/01/31/reactive-programming-java-9-flow/

=== Motivation

Generalisation

* T -> Future<T>
* Iterable<T> -> Flow.Publisher<T>

Pattern: onNext(t) 0..N [onError(Throwable) | onComplete()]

* Composability and readability
* Data as a flow manipulated with a rich vocabulary of operators
* Nothing happens until you subscribe
* Back pressure the consumer can signal the producer that the rate of emission is too high
* High level but high value abstraction that is concurrency-agnostic


“Reactive Streams”-Standard defines simple interfaces and rules (incl. test kit TCK) +
=> which are now in java9 as Foundation
