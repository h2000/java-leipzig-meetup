== Reactive Streams (pull-push)

=== Background and motivation

**Put consumer in control of the data flow**

Generalisation

* `T -> Future<T>`
* `Iterable<T> -> Flow.Publisher<T>`


Highlights

* Composability and readability
* Data as a flow manipulated with a rich vocabulary of operators
* Back pressure the consumer can signal the producer that the rate of emission is too high
* High level but high value abstraction that is concurrency-agnostic


“Reactive Streams”-Standard defines simple interfaces and rules (incl. test kit TCK) +
=> new foundation in Java 9 for implementation of reactive for example JDBC, Kafka drivers and adapters 

=== New interfaces and classes

* interfaces (impl. must be compliant to the Reactive Streams Standard)
** `Flow.Publisher<T>` : produces items and control signals
** `Flow.Subscriber<T>` : receives items and signals
** `Flow.Subscription` : links the Publisher and Subscriber
** `Flow.Processor<T,R>`` : has advanced operations e.g. to chain transformations of items from Publisher to Subscriber
* class `SubmissionPublisher<T>` implements Publisher<T> and is a flexible producer of items, good starting point for own implementations
